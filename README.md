NBA Shot Attempt Trends (2003–2023)

This project analyzes trends in three-point (3PA) and two-point (2PA) shot attempts per game across all NBA teams over the past 20 seasons (2003–2023). 
The data is pulled directly from the NBA's official stats API using the nba_api Python package.

Objective

To visualize how the NBA’s shot selection has evolved over time, with a focus on the shift toward the three-point shot and the decline of mid-range/two-point attempts.
Technologies Used
-Python

-Pandas for data manipulation

-Matplotlib for data visualization

-nba_api for programmatically pulling NBA stats

Visualizations

-3PA Trend Line: Shows the steady increase in three-point attempts.

-2PA Trend Line: Shows the gradual decline in two-point attempts.

How to Run
